2 big questions
	- How to handle arp flooding
		. the arp seems only to happen with ip addresses within the same subnet
			[.] do I simply return the mac of the router itself
			[.] or do I return the real make of the destination ip
				- If I return the real make of the destination ip then when performing ping between 2 hosts in the same subnet the dest_mac_addr will be of the destination host rather than the router which by definiation should be dropped


	- the Flow tables in the routers sometimes drop automatically, I mean they initally have enteries but when trying to print the flow tables again all those enteries are sort of deleted

	- Can this be simplified using wildcards given that if wildcards is used the dst_mac will be non-accurate
		. *** r2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 cookie=0x0, duration=42.572s, table=0, n_packets=17, n_bytes=1666, idle_timeout=60, priority=1,ip,nw_dst=112.97.37.9 actions=mod_dl_dst:00:cc:cc:cc:cc:aa,mod_dl_src:00:dd:dd:dd:dd:aa,dec_ttl,output:"r2-eth1"

 cookie=0x0, duration=42.504s, table=0, n_packets=17, n_bytes=1666, idle_timeout=60, priority=1,ip,nw_dst=112.97.37.201 actions=mod_dl_dst:00:cc:cc:cc:cc:bb,mod_dl_src:00:dd:dd:dd:dd:aa,dec_ttl,output:"r2-eth1"

 cookie=0x0, duration=42.443s, table=0, n_packets=23, n_bytes=2254, idle_timeout=60, priority=1,ip,nw_dst=1.2.3.4 actions=mod_dl_dst:00:ee:ee:ee:ee:aa,mod_dl_src:00:dd:dd:dd:dd:cc,dec_ttl,output:"r2-eth3"

	- Is it normal to make the idle_timeout=0 for the flow-entry that sends packets to the controller
		. as by default it is set to 60 seconds of inactivity

	- If the firewall dropped a packet in a router does it have to return some icmp error
		. Because when tcp is blocked for h3 and h4 curl never terminates
		. Also, ask about the default blocking behaviour of the firewall
		. Is it a good idea to have the firewall rules in the router never destroyed

	- Why does ping replies to the router not received by the controller, although ping is successful
		. It works only when I manually enter the ip address of the router and that is because a router have multiple ip(s)

	- can a flow table create icmp packets locally
		. the controller is the one responsible for creating the packets

	- when ttl is equal to zero should the packet be sent back to the controller to construct the icmp packet



>>>> Document why you have choosen specific values in the code
	. Add explanation why you have firewall rules never die and how they work
	. Add explanation why you have the time for the mismatch rule to be 0, else the router will not be able to communicate with the controller
	. add explanation why do you split the ips for h3 and h4, although in the routing table only a single wildcarded entery is added the reason is that we will modify the dst_mac address of the destination host and that is why we can't add a wildcard
